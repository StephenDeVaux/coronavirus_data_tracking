# coronavirus_data_tracking

Extremely rough and ready code! Pretty crappy and likely to break.... 

Purpose was to import data from .csv file sort it and export it back to .csv file. 
The data is sorted such that the provinces are summed up into 1 country, and that they all start with a column day 1 that is the first day they have over 100 cases of coronavirus.

The data is publicly available from this repository:
